    <h5>NASA leadership had a lot to say after today's explosive first test flight of SpaceX's Starship.

      NASA has tapped Starship for its upcoming Artemis 3 mission, which will put astronauts back on the moon no earlier
      than 2025. Following that, Starship will also ferry human crews to the lunar surface and back for Artemis 4 and
      perhaps also Artemis 5, according to NASA's current plans.

      With so much banking on the successful development of the massive stainless steel vehicle, NASA leaders took the
      opportunity to hail today's flight test as an important step forward in the agency's moon plans.

      NASA Administrator Bill Nelson praised the launch, congratulating SpaceX and writing on Twitter(opens in new tab)
      that "Every great achievement throughout history has demanded some level of calculated risk, because with great
      risk comes great reward. Looking forward to all that SpaceX learns, to the next flight test — and beyond."

      Congrats to @SpaceX on Starship’s first integrated flight test! Every great achievement throughout history has
      demanded some level of calculated risk, because with great risk comes great reward. Looking forward to all that
      SpaceX learns, to the next flight test—and beyond. https://t.co/ZYsh5VkxsAApril 20, 2023</h5>
